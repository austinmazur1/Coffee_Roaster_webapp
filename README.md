## About

This is a long term, work in progress project. Direction and final product is subject to change along the way.

As a coffee lover, living in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. I am very fortunate to have a few quality coffee roasters nearby, as well as several cafes showcasing beans roasted local and throughout Europe. 

This got me thinking, would be kinda cool to have an encyclopedia of sorts for roasters. The beans they are offering and potentially expanding to cafes and what they are serving up.
