## About

### Inspiration
As a passionate coffee enthusiast residing in the vibrant city of Palma de Mallorca, Spain, I find myself in the fortunate position of being surrounded by a diverse array of quality coffee roasters. The local scene is bustling, not only with roasters who meticulously craft their beans but also with cafes that bring together a selection of the finest coffees from across Europe. This unique environment sparked an idea â€” a project born from a love for coffee and a desire to explore and document the rich coffee culture that surrounds me.

### Project Vision
Coffeepedia: A comprehensive digital encyclopedia dedicated to coffee roasters and cafes. At its heart, this project aims to serve as a dynamic platform where coffee lovers can discover and learn about local and European roasters, the beans they offer, and the cafes that feature these carefully roasted beans.

### Current State and Future Directions
This project is a long-term, evolving journey, with its direction and final outcome open to adaptation as it progresses. Currently in its early stages, the focus is on:

Cataloging Roasters: Building a detailed directory of coffee roasters, starting locally and expanding to include notable names across Europe.
Showcasing Beans: Providing insights into the variety of beans each roaster offers, including tasting notes, origin stories, and brewing recommendations.
Exploring Cafes: Eventually extending the platform to feature cafes, highlighting their coffee selections and the experience they offer.
